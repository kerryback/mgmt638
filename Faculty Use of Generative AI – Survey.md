# Faculty Use of Generative AI – Survey

For this survey, “generative AI” includes tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Replit AI, Lovable, GitHub Copilot, etc.

Throughout, check the box if something applies (you “have used” it).  
Leave it blank if you have not used generative AI in that way in the past 12 months.

### Q1. Assignments that ask students to use generative AI outside of class

Instructions:  
For this question, we are only interested in situations where you explicitly asked or required students to use generative AI outside of live class sessions (for homework, projects, preparation, or self-study) in the past 12 months.

Check the box for each type of activity that you have asked students to do using generative AI outside of class in at least one of your courses.  
If you have never asked students to use generative AI outside of class, leave all items in this question blank.

- [ ] Online research or fact-finding (e.g., exploring a topic, gathering or summarizing information, generating examples)  
- [ ] Brainstorming ideas (e.g., project topics, business ideas, marketing campaigns, strategies, alternatives)  
- [ ] Drafting or revising written work (e.g., reports, memos, presentations)  
- [ ] Data analysis or coding (e.g., writing or debugging code, running analyses, creating visualizations – including use as a coding assistant)  
- [ ] Using generative AI as a tutor or study coach (e.g., to explain concepts, walk through solutions, or create practice questions)  
- [ ] Preparing for exams (e.g., generating practice questions, study plans, or summaries of course material)  
- [ ] Practicing communication outside class (e.g., mock interviews, pitches, or role-play with AI)  
- [ ] Asking generative AI to critique or improve their own work (e.g., suggest improvements, alternatives, or corrections)  
- [ ] Other ways I have asked students to use generative AI outside class (briefly specify):  __________________

### Q2. In-class uses (role-playing, data analysis, chatting, other)

Instructions:  
In the past 12 months, in any course you taught, check the box for each way you have used generative AI live during class (in-person or synchronous online).  
If you have not used generative AI in a particular way, leave it blank.

- [ ] Chatting / Q&A in class: Asking an AI tool questions in front of the class (e.g., explanations, definitions, worked examples)  
- [ ] Brainstorming with the class: Using AI in class to generate ideas, examples, or strategies together with students  
- [ ] Role-playing / simulations: Having AI act as a stakeholder (e.g., customer, manager, regulator, negotiation counterpart)  
- [ ] Data analysis in class: Using an AI tool to run data analysis or code live in class (e.g., regression, simulation, visualization)  
- [ ] Coding demonstrations: Using an AI coding assistant in class to write or debug code in real time  
- [ ] Generating or modifying cases / scenarios on the fly in response to class discussion  
- [ ] Using AI to check or verify answers during class (e.g., checking numerical answers or alternative solutions)  
- [ ] Using AI to give feedback on sample student answers during class  
- [ ] Other in-class uses of generative AI (briefly specify):  ______________

### Q3. AI policies and misuse

Instructions:  
Check each statement that is true for at least one of your courses in the most recent twelve months.  
Leave any statement blank if it is not true for any of your courses.

- [ ] I have an explicit written policy on student use of generative AI in at least one course (e.g., in the syllabus or LMS).  
- [ ] I have talked in class about how students may or may not use generative AI in at least one course.  
- [ ] I have no explicit policy on student use of generative AI in any of my courses.  
- [ ] I have experienced what I believe was student misuse of AI in at least one of my courses.  Please describe, even if misuse was not definitely established. ________________

### Q4. What you allow or require (learning vs assignments)

Instructions:  
For each statement below, check the box if it is true of at least one course you taught in the most recent academic year.  
If it is not true for any course, leave it blank.

- [ ] I allow students to use generative AI for learning (e.g., summarizing readings, asking questions) in at least one course.  
- [ ] I allow students to use generative AI to help with graded written assignments in at least one course.  
- [ ] I allow students to use generative AI to help with graded coding or data analysis assignments in at least one course.  
- [ ] I explicitly prohibit student use of generative AI for graded assignments in at least one course.  
- [ ] I require students to disclose any use of generative AI on graded work in at least one course.  
- [ ] I have at least one course where using generative AI is a required or central part of the coursework.

For the next questions, we distinguish between:

- Chat-based tools (primarily text/chat interfaces)  
- Coding / code-execution tools (primarily used for coding or running code / data analysis)

For each tool, you can mark:

- “Used myself” = you have personally used or experimented with this tool for research, teaching, or other professional work.  
- “Used with students” = you have used, demonstrated, required, or explicitly recommended this tool for students in at least one course.  

If neither applies, leave both blank.
