## Section 3 – Asking students to use generative AI outside of class

### Q5. Assignments that ask students to use generative AI outside of class

**Instructions:**  
For this question, we are only interested in situations where you **explicitly asked or required students to use generative AI outside of live class sessions** (for homework, projects, preparation, or self-study) in the past 12 months.

Check the box for each type of activity that you have asked students to do using generative AI **outside of class** in at least one of your courses.  
If you have never asked students to use generative AI outside of class, leave all items in this question blank.

- [ ] Online **research or fact-finding** (e.g., exploring a topic, gathering or summarizing information, generating examples)  
- [ ] **Brainstorming ideas** (e.g., project topics, business ideas, marketing campaigns, strategies, alternatives)  
- [ ] **Drafting or revising written work** (e.g., reports, memos, presentations)  
- [ ] **Data analysis or coding** (e.g., writing or debugging code, running analyses, creating visualizations – including use as a coding assistant)  
- [ ] Using generative AI as a **tutor or study coach** (e.g., to explain concepts, walk through solutions, or create practice questions)  
- [ ] **Preparing for exams** (e.g., generating practice questions, study plans, or summaries of course material)  
- [ ] **Practicing communication** outside class (e.g., mock interviews, pitches, or role-play with AI)  
- [ ] Asking generative AI to **critique or improve their own work** (e.g., suggest improvements, alternatives, or corrections)  
- [ ] Other ways I have asked students to use generative AI outside class (briefly specify):

## Section 4 – Use of generative AI with students in class

### Q6. In-class uses (role-playing, data analysis, chatting, other)

**Instructions:**  
In the past 12 months, in any course you taught, check the box for each way you have used generative AI **live during class** (in-person or synchronous online).  
If you have not used generative AI in a particular way, leave it blank.

- [ ] **Chatting / Q&A in class:** Asking an AI tool questions in front of the class (e.g., explanations, definitions, worked examples)  
- [ ] **Brainstorming with the class:** Using AI in class to generate ideas, examples, or strategies together with students  
- [ ] **Role-playing / simulations:** Having AI act as a stakeholder (e.g., customer, manager, regulator, negotiation counterpart)  
- [ ] **Data analysis in class:** Using an AI tool to run data analysis or code live in class (e.g., regression, simulation, visualization)  
- [ ] **Coding demonstrations:** Using an AI coding assistant in class to write or debug code in real time  
- [ ] **Generating or modifying cases / scenarios on the fly** in response to class discussion

## Section 6 – Tool list (chat vs code-execution tools)

For these questions, we distinguish between:

- **Chat-based tools** (primarily text/chat interfaces)  
- **Coding / code-execution tools** (primarily used for coding or running code / data analysis)

For each tool, you can mark:

- **“Used myself”** = you have personally used or experimented with this tool for research, teaching, or other professional work.  
- **“Used with students”** = you have used, demonstrated, required, or explicitly recommended this tool for students in at least one course.  

If neither applies, leave both blank.
