# The Nature and Extent of Quantitative Equity Investing: A Comprehensive Report

## Executive Summary

Quantitative equity investing has emerged as a dominant force in modern finance, representing approximately $2-3 trillion in global assets under management (AUM) as of 2024. This approach, which employs mathematical models, statistical analysis, and increasingly artificial intelligence to make investment decisions, has transformed from a niche strategy to a mainstream investment methodology adopted across hedge funds, mutual funds, and ETFs. By 2024, global quant fund AUM reached approximately $2-3 trillion, with quant hedge funds alone managing ~$1.2-1.5 trillion (25-30% of total hedge fund AUM of $4.5-4.9 trillion).

## 1. Introduction and Definition

### What is Quantitative Equity Investing?

Quantitative investing employs mathematical methods, probability and statistical analysis, and data analytics, including techniques from machine learning, to develop trading strategies, construct portfolios, and manage risk. Unlike traditional fundamental investing that relies on human judgment and company-specific analysis, quantitative strategies use systematic, rules-based approaches to identify investment opportunities.

The process relies heavily on mathematical models, statistical analysis, and computer algorithms to identify investment opportunities and make informed decisions, seeking to remove emotional bias and introduce a more objective, data-driven approach.

### Historical Development

Active quantitative equity investing can trace its roots back to Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, when they published 'Security Analysis' that urged investors to consider a disciplined framework to analyze securities. The field gained significant momentum in the late 1970s when academic papers demonstrated that investors could achieve excess returns by systematically applying certain financial characteristics.

Sam Eisenstadt established the roots of quant investing in 1965, creating the first quantitative ranking system using 6-month trailing performance. However, it wasn't until the 21st century that quantitative investing gained popularity, along with the emergence of advanced computers and statistical software.

## 2. Core Strategies and Methodologies

### 2.1 Factor Investing

Factor investing represents the foundation of many quantitative strategies. Five factors – value, quality, momentum, size, and minimum volatility – have shown to be resilient across time, markets, asset classes, and have a strong economic rationale.

Common quantitative strategies include:

- **Value Investing**: Quantitative value investing employs statistical models to identify undervalued stocks using financial metrics such as price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio, and dividend yield
- **Momentum Strategies**: Investing in stocks showing strong recent performance trends
- **Risk Parity**: Risk parity investing allocates assets in a way that ensures each asset contributes equally to the overall portfolio risk
- **Statistical Arbitrage**: Exploiting temporary price discrepancies between related securities
- **Multi-Factor Models**: Combining multiple factors for more robust predictions

### 2.2 Implementation Methods

Three types of quantitative equity strategies exist: fundamental quantitative investing, statistical arbitrage, and high-frequency trading (HFT). Each differs in:
- Conceptual basis and turnover rates
- Capacity constraints
- Trade determination methods
- Backtesting reliability

## 3. Quantitative Investing in Hedge Funds

### 3.1 Market Size and Dominance

Hedge funds represent the largest segment of quantitative investing. Quant hedge funds alone manage approximately $1.2-1.5 trillion, representing 25-30% of total hedge fund AUM. Total hedge fund assets reached $3.1 trillion by the end of 2024.

### 3.2 Performance in 2024

The quant master strategy returned +8.7% in 2024, with quant – multi posting +17.4% returns, showcasing strong risk-adjusted performance with a five-year Sharpe ratio of 1.4. However, performance varied significantly:
- Equity quant strategies showed the best returns, with systematic hedge funds performing well in 2024
- CTAs (quant – CTA) underperformed at just +1.5%, while quant – macro returned +9.6%

## 4. Quantitative Investing in Mutual Funds

### 4.1 Market Penetration

Vanguard reported in 2006 that quantitative strategies accounted for ~16% of U.S. actively managed assets, up from 13% in 2003, a share estimated to have grown to ~20% by 2024. This represents significant growth in adoption among traditional asset managers.

### 4.2 Major Players and Strategies

Large asset managers have embraced quantitative approaches:
- BlackRock and DFA have launched quantitatively managed mutual funds, with equity strategies historically dominating but fixed-income and multi-asset quantitative funds gaining traction
- Fidelity Investments managed around $5.9 trillion by 2024, with significant quantitative strategies in its mutual fund offerings

### 4.3 Growth Trends

In 2024, 50% of surveyed organizations reported incorporating AI into at least one business function in their mutual fund operations, up from 20% in 2020. This demonstrates rapid adoption of quantitative and AI-driven approaches in traditional mutual fund management.

## 5. Quantitative Investing in ETFs

### 5.1 Smart Beta and Factor ETFs

The ETF industry has been transformed by quantitative strategies, particularly through smart beta products:
- The Invesco S&P 500® Equal Weight ETF (RSP) launched in 2003, becoming the first smart beta ETF
- Factor ETFs deliver the power of time-tested investment screens in a low-cost and tax-efficient investment vehicle, revolutionizing access for everyday investors

### 5.2 Active ETFs Revolution

Active ETFs represent only 7 percent of overall ETF AUM in 2024, yet they captured 37 percent of ETF flows and nearly 24 percent of ETF-driven revenues. More than 1,400 active ETFs have launched in the past five years, with roughly as many active ETFs as passive ETFs now available.

### 5.3 Fund Flows and Performance

In Q1 2024, active equity ETFs accounted for 25% of equity ETF inflows despite making up only 5% of AUM. In fixed income, $17.8B (37%) of the $47.9B that went into Fixed Income ETFs came from active strategies despite only making up 12% of Fixed Income ETF AUM.

## 6. The AI and Machine Learning Revolution

## Conclusion

Quantitative equity investing has fundamentally transformed the investment management industry, growing from academic theory to a multi-trillion dollar sector that spans hedge funds, mutual funds, and ETFs. With approximately $2-3 trillion in global AUM and representing 25-30% of hedge fund assets, quantitative strategies have proven their staying power and effectiveness.

The integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning is accelerating this transformation, with nearly half of quantitative investors already incorporating AI into their processes. As computational power increases and data availability expands, quantitative investing is likely to continue its growth trajectory, though challenges around scalability, market volatility, and regulatory compliance remain.

The future of quantitative equity investing appears bright, with continued innovation in AI/ML applications, growing adoption across traditional asset managers, and increasing accessibility through ETFs and other vehicles making sophisticated quantitative strategies available to a broader range of investors. As the industry evolves, the line between quantitative and traditional investing continues to blur, suggesting that data-driven, systematic approaches will become increasingly central to investment management across all asset classes and investment vehicles.
