## Quick Installation

The easiest way to install skills is to ask Claude Code to do it for you:

**Tell Claude Code:**
```
"Download and install the rice-data-query and merge skills, plus CLAUDE.md
from mgmt638.kerryback.com/skills/"
```

Claude Code will download the files and place them in the correct location.

## Manual Installation

If you prefer to install manually, follow these steps:

### 1. Directory Structure

Skills must be placed in `.claude/skills/` within your course folder:

```
your-course-folder/
├── .claude/
│   └── skills/
│       ├── rice-data-query/
│       │   ├── SKILL.md
│       │   ├── README.md
│       │   ├── rice_monthly_returns.py
│       │   └── rice_sf1_query.py
│       └── merge/
│           ├── SKILL.md
│           ├── README.md
│           └── merge_returns_fundamentals.py
```

### 2. Create the Directory

## Getting Help

Each skill includes a README.md file with detailed documentation. If you encounter issues:

1. Check that files are in the correct directory (`.claude/skills/`)
2. Ensure all required files are present for each skill
3. Restart Claude Code if skills don't appear immediately
4. Ask Claude Code to check the skill installation
